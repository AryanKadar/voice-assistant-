Hello everyone,
	
	Here is new project that is used in our daily life ,we call this by many name like siri,alexa etc. I have made a very basic model of voice assistant that has many feature.

	1.The job of voice assistant is to do the task that the person ask them to do.
	
	2.There are two assistant in this program(Male assistant-David,female assistant) that are in service to help user to make life little easy.The assistant can be change any time user want to them to change.
	
	3.There are many small feature that this voice assistant has such open and ask what they want to search on youtube,google and wikipedia.Also it also open gmail for user.It also greets (good morning,good afternoon,good evening and good day)you according to the time of that day.

	5.There are many important feature in the program such as send mail(by asking subject,content and mail of person you want to send),this feature can rectify user mistake by adding "@gmail.com" at end if user forget to say and also it doesn'tproceed of sending mail unless it get second confirmation from user by asking the user if the subject ,content or mail of person is correct or not.Setting reminder(by asking day,date and content of reminder) and also after pc is rebooted the reminder will still remember by run in backend has start up app.

			4.Also on line 16 and 17 of "va.py" file in front of "Email" and "Pass" type your own email and pass.
			5.Goto Search->run->%AppData%->Microsoft->Windows->start Menu->Programs->Startup and paste start_rem.bat that has been decompressed from fyc.rar and also let there be one more copy of start_rem.bat at folder where every thing is stored.
